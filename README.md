# Before Metis

These materials are designed to ensure you are ready to succeed in the
Metis data science bootcamp. An average person might spend about 40
hours preparing with these materials.

**All exercises _must_ be completed before the first day of class.**

 1. [Set up your repository on GitHub](01-set_up_repo.md)
 2. [Install software on your computer](02-install.md)
 3. [Choose and learn your editor(s)](03-editors.md)
 4. [Learn command line](04-command_line.md)
 5. [Learn Python](05-python.md)
 6. [Learn Statistics](06-statistics.md)

To go beyond the exercises here, one interesting type of project is to
simulate a system of interest programmatically and analyze the
simulation statistically. You could do such a project and keep it in
its own repo.
